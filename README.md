# Vilearnx-Task-2
This particular task is a linear regression model that can predict the Sale Price of houses in the Ames Housing dataset with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of {mse:.2f} and an R-squared (R2) of {r2:.2f}. The model's performance is visualized through a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted Sale Prices and a distribution of residuals.
